Object Detection Using YOLOv8 on KITTI 2D Dataset
Project Overview
The objective of this proof of concept (POC) project is to create an object detection model using the KITTI 2D dataset. The model aims to accurately detect various objects in normal weather conditions using the YOLOv8 architecture, leveraging the Ultralytics framework for model development. Additionally, the model is deployed on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Developer Kit for real-time inference.
Detailed Description
Background
Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision with applications in autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics. The KITTI 2D dataset, which provides labeled images of urban scenes, is a benchmark dataset widely used for evaluating object detection models. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection framework known for its speed and accuracy. YOLOv8, the latest version, improves upon previous versions by incorporating advanced techniques and optimizations. Ultralytics, the team behind YOLOv8, has developed an easy-to-use framework that simplifies the process of implementing and training object detection models.
Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate an object detection model capable of accurately identifying and localizing various objects such as cars, pedestrians, and cyclists in urban environments. The specific objectives include:
1. Data Preparation: Preprocess the KITTI 2D dataset to be compatible with the YOLOv8 framework, including annotation conversion and data augmentation.
2. Model Training: Train the YOLOv8 model using the Ultralytics framework on the prepared dataset, fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).
4. Model Deployment: Convert the trained model to ONNX format and deploy it on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Developer Kit for real-time inference.
5. Result Analysis: Analyze the results to identify strengths and weaknesses, and propose improvements.
Dataset Details:
* Training Set: 7481 images
* Test Set: 7518 images
